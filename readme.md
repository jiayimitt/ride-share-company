# SwiftLyft Rideshare Web Application

SwiftLyft is a fictional rideshare company website that demonstrates how to integrate the HTML5 Geolocation API with the Mapbox API. Users can view their current location, recenter the map on themselves, and display simulated nearby rideshare vehicles.

## Features

- **User Location Retrieval:**  
  Uses the browser’s Geolocation API to find the user's current location and center the map on it.
  
- **Map Display with Mapbox:**  
  Integrates Mapbox GL JS to render a dynamic, interactive map.

- **Recenter Button:**  
  A "Recenter on Me" button to easily navigate the map view back to the user's current position.

- **Show Nearby Vehicles:**  
  A button that simulates showing nearby rideshare vehicles by placing multiple markers around the user’s location.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies for structure, styling, and logic.
- **Mapbox GL JS**: For embedding an interactive map and markers.
- **Geolocation API**: To detect and use the user's current position.
- **Local Development Server**: Such as VSCode Live Server or a simple HTTP server to serve files locally.
